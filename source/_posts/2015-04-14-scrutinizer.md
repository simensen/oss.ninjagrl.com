Our fourth #ossart entry is dedicated to [Scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com), a continuous inspection platform. Though not strictly open source software itself, Scrutinizer is used by many open source projects to help measure and track code quality and find bugs!

We sent a few teaser images out on Twitter (you're following <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ossart">#ossart</a>, right?) and we got a bunch of guesses! Matthew Weier O'Phinney ([@mwop](https://twitter.com/mwop/status/585844399407435776)).

The original piece measures 16" x 12".

We also have prints available for <a href="{{ page.product.link }}">purchase now</a> starting at just $20!
