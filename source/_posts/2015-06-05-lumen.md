Our sixth #ossart entry is dedicated to [Lumen](http://lumen.laravel.com/), a micro-framework by [Laravel](http://laravel.com/).

The first person to guess Lumen was [Beth Tucker Long](https://twitter.com/e3betht)! She guessed it based on [a very early sketch](https://twitter.com/ninjagrlstuff/status/606171454250450944) because she thought she saw a light bulb. I think Turtle may have made a similar mistake.

The original piece measures 16" x 12".

We also have prints available for <a href="{{ page.product.link }}">purchase now</a> starting at just $20!
