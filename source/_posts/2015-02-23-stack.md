Our second #ossart entry is dedicated to <a href="http://stackphp.com">Stack PHP</a>, a PHP middleware reference implementation by <a href="https://igor.io/">Igor Wiedler</a>, <a href="https://beau.io">Beau Simensen</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/hochchristoph">Christoph Hochstrasser</a>.

We sent a few teaser images out on Twitter (you're following <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ossart">#ossart</a>, right?) and we got a few guesses! The first person to correctly guess the project this time around was <a href="https://twitter.com/mwop/status/567879562551386112">@mwop</a>! Nicely done!

Now that [PSR-7 under review](http://srcmvn.com/blog/2015/02/18/psr-7-and-the-future-of-php/), Stack PHP may soon be undergoing a transformation into something... different. Follow [@stackphp](https://twitter.com/stackphp) to learn more!

The original piece measures 10" x 20" and will be available for purchase in February!

We also have prints available for <a href="{{ page.product.link }}">purchase now</a> starting at just $20!
