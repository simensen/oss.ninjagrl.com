Our third #ossart entry is dedicated to [PHP-FIG](http://php-fig.org), the PHP Framework Interoperability Group.

We sent a few teaser images out on Twitter (you're following <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ossart">#ossart</a>, right?) and we got a bunch of guesses! Kayla Daniels ([@kayladnls](https://twitter.com/kayladnls)) was the first to guess FIG!

The original piece measures 16" x 12" and will be available for purchase in April!

We also have prints available for <a href="{{ page.product.link }}">purchase now</a> starting at just $20!
