Our fifth #ossart entry is dedicated to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), a static blogging framework for hackers, based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and created by [Brandon Mathis](https://twitter.com/imathis).

Bec painted this one so quickly we didn't even get any nice progress shots in for teasers (you're following <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ossart">#ossart</a>, right?)! Instead, we posted the final piece in its entirety! The first person to guess Octopress was [Chris Hartjes](https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer). Not only that, [he guessed it in record time](https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer/status/592657909584162816)! 29 seconds! Way to go, Grumpy!

The original piece measures 16" x 12".

We also have prints available for <a href="{{ page.product.link }}">purchase now</a> starting at just $20!
